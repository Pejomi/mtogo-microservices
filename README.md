## OpenApi/Swagger with Spring Security

The browser might ask for credentials when accessing the swagger-ui.html page. Spring Security is enabled by default with credentials:
* Username: user
* Password: the password is printed in the console at startup (standard output)

Like this:
`Using generated security password: ce923da1-e0a7-449f-8e03-d9e74c0f1461` (the password is different every time)
